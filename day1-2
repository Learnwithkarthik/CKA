Task 1

Create a pod using the imperative command and use nginx as the image
Task2

Create the YAML from the nginx pod created in task 1
Update the pod name in the YAML
Use that YAML to create a new pod with the name nginx-new.
Task3

Apply the below YAML and fix the errors, including all the commands that you run during the troubleshooting and the error message
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: test
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - image: rediss
    name: redis

Task2:
In this exercise, you will create a Deployment with multiple replicas. After inspecting the Deployment, you will update its Pod template. You will also be able to use the rollout history to roll back to a previous revision.

Replicaset
Create a new Replicaset based on the nginx image with 3 replicas
Update the replicas to 4 from the YAML
Update the replicas to 6 from the command line
Deployment
Create a Deployment named nginx with 3 replicas. The Pods should use the nginx:1.23.0 image and the name nginx. The Deployment uses the label tier=backend. The Pod template should use the label app=v1.
List the Deployment and ensure the correct number of replicas is running.
Update the image to nginx:1.23.4.
Verify that the change has been rolled out to all replicas.
Assign the change cause "Pick up patch version" to the revision.
Scale the Deployment to 5 replicas.
Have a look at the Deployment rollout history.
Revert the Deployment to revision 1.
Ensure that the Pods use the image nginx:1.23.0.
